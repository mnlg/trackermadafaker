# Tracker Madafaker

Tracker Madafaker is a fucking simple and minimalistic time tracker for [BitBar](https://getbitbar.com).

## Install

Just download the trackermadafaker script and copy it to your BitBar plugins folder.

## Use

First you'll need to add some projects to track, add them in the projects file via the options menu `(:angry: -> Options -> Edit projects file)`. Add one project per line.

You'll need to wait until BitBar refreshes the plugin to see your projects, but _fuck waiting_: refresh it manually via the options menu.

Select a project to start tracking the time spent on it (surprise madafaker!). Select it again to  stop tracking.

__Tracker Madafaker__ will only track one project at a time.
